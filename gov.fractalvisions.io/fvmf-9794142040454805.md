## Fractal Visions Mission Fund
The Fractal Visions Mission Fund is for fellow impact makers in web3 who are building projects that contribute to public goods. Utilizing the Optimism network & Layer 2 scaling blockchain technology with the Gitcoin Grants Stack gives Fractal Visions ecosystem the opportunity to reiterate Quadratic Funding with the "Mission Fund" as the public goods community grows. 

The community can choose from a selection of different categories that align with their vision and values regarding the future of blockchain development. 

The “Fractal Visions Mission Fund” further expands the scope of participation within the niche community of impact makers from the very early beginning of a regenerative movement. Each “Mission” from the Pilot Programs help contribute to momentum of the public goods flywheel every QF round.
