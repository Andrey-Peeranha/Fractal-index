Vitalik Buterin

Vitaly Dmitrievich Buterin (Russian: Вита́лий Дми́триевич Буте́рин), better known as Vitalik Buterin (Russian: Вита́лик Буте́рин, born 31 January[2] 1994), is a Russian-Canadian computer programmer, and co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin became involved with cryptocurrency early in its inception, co-founding Bitcoin Magazine in 2011.[3][4][5] In 2014, Buterin deployed the Ethereum blockchain with Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio, and Joseph Lubin.[6][7][8]

Buterin was born on 31 January 1994 in Russia, Kolomna, to a Russian family.[9][10] His father Dmitry was a computer scientist.[9] He and his parents lived in the area until the age of six, when his parents emigrated to Canada in search of better employment opportunities.[11] While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children and was drawn to mathematics, programming, and economics.[12] Buterin then attended The Abelard School, a private high school in Toronto.[13] Buterin learned about Bitcoin from his father, Dimitry Buterin, at the age of 17.[11]

After high school, Buterin attended the University of Waterloo. There, he took advanced courses and was a research assistant for cryptographer Ian Goldberg, who co-created Off-the-Record Messaging and was the former board of directors' chairman of the Tor Project.[14][15] In 2012, Buterin won a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics in Italy.[16]

In 2013, he visited developers in other countries who shared his enthusiasm for code. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a white paper proposing Ethereum.[17][18] He dropped out of university in 2014 when he was awarded with a grant of $100,000 from the Thiel Fellowship, a scholarship created by venture capitalist Peter Thiel and went to work on Ethereum full-time.[19]

On 30 November 2018, Buterin received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel.[20]
