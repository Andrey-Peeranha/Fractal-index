# Diligence

Check for accuracy and consistency in the workflow.

A majority of common mistakes occur from a minuscule oversight that can sometimes be as simple as a single character in a line of code or a decimal place when sending a transaction.

It's always a ton of responsibility to become the person who made a critical error or mistake when executing a task others are relying on. Make sure to work together with a teammate or group of peers who can always check over your work prior to publishing documents for accuracy whether or not the data is being permanently stored on or off chain in a file storage server.


Include a task list that has detailed checkpoints for yourself or others to follow when executing a transaction with a multi signature vault for storing treasury or grant funds.
