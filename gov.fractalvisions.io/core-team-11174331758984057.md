### Bio

IGLIVISION: This production studio is based on creating a movement of visionaries who are focused on their creative endeavors. This was my solution to give back to the community that has helped lift me up in the past.

Over the past few years the user experience gained from blockchain gaming has become extra valuable in order to create our own platform that we intend to use for setting a new standard in the web3 space when it comes to highlighting new creators who contribute to public goods. Using all the resources within our reach to put together a team of developers who are helping to bring this vision to life. Glenn has the ultimate passion to build a platform for other impact makers in the web3 space.

Artist / Production Manager

Content Creation & Creative Director

### Bio


Fractalicia: Alicia is a long time artist and has been painting with acrylic paint for over 10 years.

She is also an integral core leader of the project. The user experience is an important part of building a product for Alicia. This commitment to building on layer two networks involves the creators first hand experience as a builder of the platform which is unique. Having a second set of eyes during the design phase for the extra complexity of our user interface is also a huge benefit to the end users of the platform
