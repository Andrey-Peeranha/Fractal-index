Fractal Visions is building a layer 2 NFT Marketplace and we are giving the people with access to a special telegram chat ðŸ’¬ the opportunity to become official ambassadors and educational experts who help assist new artists & users of the platformâ€¦

We are dedicated to being a delegate for Optimism governance and introducing artists to layer 2 blockchain technology while teaching them about retroactive public goods.

Education based off & on chain oriented quests help to onboard new citizens to the layer 2 blockchains by giving them a Free NFT as a reward for completing all required tasks for participation. Additionally we also use this system for official token reward distribution quests.

Our network has grown exponentially from the Free NFT claims that help us encourage the participants to stay within the layer 2 ecosystem by creating an ongoing series of limited edition images deployed over time. This is a creative way to draw attention to blockchain scaling solutions due to the sheer mass of claims that can be made in a short amount of time using low gas costs.
