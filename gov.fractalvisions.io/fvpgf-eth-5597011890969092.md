## Fractal Visions Public Goods Fund
Creating a formula to determine the impact of retroactive work on profit can be a complex task because it depends on various factors specific to the project and the nature of the retroactive work. However, you can develop a basic formula that considers some common elements. Here's a simple formula you can use as a starting point:

Proof of Impact = (Retroactive Work Benefits - Retroactive Work Costs) / Project Duration

Where:

Retroactive Work Benefits: The financial benefits gained from the retroactive work. This could include increased sales, cost savings, improved efficiency, or any other measurable financial gain directly attributable to the retroactive work.

Retroactive Work Costs: The expenses associated with carrying out the retroactive work, including labor, materials, equipment, and any other direct costs.

Project Duration: The time it takes to complete the retroactive work and start realizing the benefits. This could be measured in days, weeks, months, or years, depending on the project's scale.

Keep in mind that this formula provides a simplified view of the impact over profit, and in practice, you may need to consider more factors and complexities. For a more accurate analysis, you might want to incorporate other variables such as the time value of money (discounting future cash flows), risk factors, and additional costs and benefits that emerge over time.

Additionally, the specific metrics used to quantify benefits and costs will vary from project to project. You'll need to define these metrics based on the goals and objectives of your retroactive work.

Always remember that financial analysis is a critical aspect of project management, and consulting with financial experts or analysts may be necessary for more complex projects to ensure accurate calculations and decision-making.

### Mission Statement


Our main goal is to help onboard both old & new users into the public goods ecosystem. The way that we accomplish this mission is by reiterating the ethos of public goods with our own implementation of a Retroactive Public Goods Funding mechanism into the design of our MVP & utilizing Quadratic Funding tools known as the Grant Stack Manager provided by Gitcoin.




### Fractal Visions Public Goods Fund

There is a 2% marketplace fee which is the main mechanism that helps fund the retroactive rewards for creators and developers.

0.5% or 1/4th of the 2% marketplace fees are directed to the FVPGF.eth - [Fractal Visions Public Goods Funding](https://app.ens.domains/fvpgf.eth) address which is a standard EVM address capable of receiving donations across many networks that are interoperable together.

These funds are distributed periodically throughout the future to the most active projects that contribute towards the overall growth & education of each individual network.

Marketplace fees that are generated & distributed through the FVPGF give value to the users and builders which in turn creates the demand for new creators to join Fractal Visions impact initiative launchpad. Improving & iterating on top of each effort as we expand to other networks over the course of the future.
